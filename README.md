# dotfiles

These are my personal configurations files that I use for software development
on my machine. I hope to use this README and my commit messages to describe
the process of creating and maintaining them as I learn.

### What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are typically configuration files that are used to tell programs on
how to run. They are called dotfiles because they use a dot/period(`.`) to
prefix the name of the directory or file (e.g.  `.gitconfig`,
`.awesome_whatever_dir`). Anything with this prefix is treated as hidden and
can be seen by typing `$ ls -a` in your terminal. Generally, users personal
configurations settings are stored in the users home directory (`~/`) in a
collection of different files.

It has become a common convention to share your
dotfiles in a single repository and use various methods to get them in the
correct spots on your local machine. Some have gone so far as to automate the
set up process so getting started on a new machine takes minimal effort.
